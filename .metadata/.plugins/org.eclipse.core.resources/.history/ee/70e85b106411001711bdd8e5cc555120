/**We're going to look for a word to see if it is in the UNIX dictionary. Words is a standard file on all UNIX and Linix computers. It is a newline-delimited list of dictionary words. It is often used by spell-checking programs.

The words file is usually stored in /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words.
If you're using a UNIX or Linux computer then you can refer to the file on your local machine. If you need the file, download it from the following link: https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords.

Get the words file on your computer. Next create a program that will prompt the user for a word or phrase. If the user enters a phrase then you will use String.split() to return an array of the words in the phrase.

String stringToSplit = "This is my string";
String delim = ' ';
String[] parts = stringToSplit.split(delim);
You will next check each word the user entered and find any that are misspelled. Create a method that takes a word and returns t/f if it exists in the dictionary (is spelled correctly).

If the user misspelled the word then tell them it is misspelled.

User enters: I really love this Java klass

Program returns: klass is not a word. Please reenter.


	
				//get a filename
				System.out.println((System.getProperty("user.dir") + File.separatorChar +"linuxwords.txt"));
			    String filename = (System.getProperty("c:\\downloads\\linuxwords.txt") + File.separatorChar +"linuxwords.txt");
				System.out.println(Paths.get("c:\\downloads\\linuxwords.txt"));
				






 Also, use Unit Testing to verify that your program works.
Bonus: If the user types list as their phrase then list all the misspelled words entered by the user.**/
